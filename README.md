📌 Project Overview
**🎯 Project Title:**
Active Bionic Antennas for Object Detection & 3D Localization with Self-Sensing Cancellation

**🔍 Objective:**
This project aims to develop a bio-inspired tactile antenna system that can accurately detect objects, localize them in 3D space, and eliminate self-induced motion noise (ego-motion cancellation). By integrating sensor fusion techniques, machine learning algorithms, and SLAM-based localization, the system enhances the perception capabilities of robots navigating dynamic environments.

💡 Key Features:
✅ Bio-Inspired Tactile Sensing: A flexible, segmented antenna that mimics insect feelers for contact-based perception.
✅ Self-Sensing Cancellation: Advanced machine learning (Echo State Networks - ESN) to filter out ego-motion noise.
✅ 3D Localization & Mapping: SLAM-based algorithms for real-time spatial awareness and object tracking.
✅ Optimized for Real-Time Processing: Low-latency embedded system implementation for robotic applications.
